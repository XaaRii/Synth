          <p class="block has-text-justified">
            <a class="is-link" href="https://github.com/XaaRii/Synth">Synth</a> is a small program written in node.js
            that can convert Spotify playlists to YouTube playlists. It was originally developed for a close group of a
            few friends, but if you provide required credentials, anyone can use it.<br><br>

            <b>Q: What does it do?</b><br>
            <b>A:</b> The app will ask for a link of your spotify playlist and then comes another question about the
            destination playlist (on YouTube). If this is the first time you are using Synth, you will be prompted to
            authorise this application with your YouTube (Google) account. After you've selected both playlists, Synth
            will find the songs on YouTube and add them to your selected playlist. The app will then remember which
            songs were added already to avoid duplicates, so the next time you run it, only the new songs will be
            searched for.<br>

            <b>Q: How is it beneficial to the user?</b><br>
            <b>A:</b> Imagine this situation: You have hundreds of songs on Spotify, but for some reason you need to
            convert your playlist to YouTube. Instead of manually going through each song and searching it, you can let
            Synth handle it all, it's way faster and more efficient.<br>

            <b>Q: How will this app use my data?</b><br>
            <b>A:</b> This application will only use your data to search the equivalent songs on YouTube and add them in
            your playlist. Nothing else.<br>

            <b>Q: Alright, I wanna use it for myself. What do i need to do?</b><br>
            <b>A:</b> Check out <a href="#installation">Installation</a> for more detailed info.

        <p class="block has-text-justified">
          In order to run this program, you need to have a working version of node.js on your computer.<br>
          You will also need to have a valid Spotify account and YouTube (Google) account. <br>
          There are two options: you can either use <a href="#installation-global">global credentials (easier)</a> or <a
            href="#installation-own">own credentials</a>.<br>
          After that, the only thing left to do is start the app! Run <code>start.bat</code> file and it will now run.
        <section id="installation-global">
          <h4><b>Global credentials:</b></h4>
          <p>
            note: I am currently trying to verify my application at Google. After that is done, it will be possible for
            anyone to use (no need to set up own API projects and keys). I will update this part once that happens.
          </p> <br>
        </section>
        <section id="installation-own">
          <h4><b>Own credentials:</b></h4>
          First, <a href="https://github.com/XaaRii/Synth">download the source code of this app on GitHub</a>. Rename
          the <code>template.credentials.json</code> into <code>credentials.json</code> <b>and fill in the required
          fields:</b><br>
          <b>- For Spotify API:</b> go to the address <a
            href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications">https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications</a>,
          log in and create yourself a new project. After that, copy the client ID and client secret and paste them into
          your <code>credentials.json</code><br>
          <b>- For Google API:</b> <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=youtube">use this quick
            setup</a> to create a new project and assign the right APIs. After enabling them, go to 'Credentials' and
          create a new oAuth client. If it asks you to configure your consent screen, do it (type: 'External', scopes:
          '/auth/youtube', test users: add your own gmail) and then try creating an oAuth client again (type: Desktop
          app). Lastly, copy the client ID and client secret and paste them into your <code>credentials.json</code>

          <b><i>Synthâ€™s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a

        </p>

        Synth uses access to the YouTube account of the end user only in order to add the desired songs into the
        playlist owned (and picked) by the end user.<br>
        Synth will only use the provided data with the purpose of working for the end user and satisfying their
        desires.<br>
        Synth stores locally the oAuth token (so the user won't have to log in each time) as well as some basic info (in
        order to avoid requesting input from user every time the app is opened)<br>
        Synth does not share any Google user data with other applications or services.<br>
        Synth does not contain any ads, therefore it will never use provided data to serve users advertisements.<br>
        Synth will never send any user data to the developer or anyone associated with them.
